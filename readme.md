The title, _"Understanding Flexbox: Everything you need to know,"_ may seem messed up. No one can fit everything there is to a subject within one article, and even if such person existed, it isn't me.
Still, I'd take on the challenge to discuss "everything" you need to get good with the CSS Flexbox model. I hope you're ready for it.


### The Learning Curve

Here is a tweet from [Philip Roberts](https://andyet.com/team/phil/), someone I respect very much.

Learning Flexbox may not be fun at first. It challenges what you know about layouts in CSS. But that's fine. Everything worth learning begins that way. Flexbox is certainly something you should take seriously. It paves the way for the modern style of laying out content, and it's not going away anytime soon.
Flexbox is a big player in this new standard. So with outstretched arms, embrace it!


### What you'll Learn
I'll first walk you through the basics of Flexbox. I believe any attempt at understanding Flexbox must begin here

Learning the fundamentals is cool. What's even cooler is applying this knowledge to real world use. Hence, I'll walk you through building a lot of "small things". Afterwards, I'll wrap things up with this music app completely laid out with Flexbox.

Doesn't that look pretty? I'll get into the inner workings of Flexbox as you learn to build the Music app. Oh, and you'd also see how all these play out in responsive design too.

I'm pretty much excited to show all of this to you

I wouldn't start off with just building stuffs. There's going to be some boring drilling first. You may not like that, but it's all part of the process of making you adept at Flexbox. Let's get started!
