## Oh my gosh, flexbox solved that?
Some classic problems we've faced with css have been made really easy and trivially solved by flexbox.
[Philip Walton](https://philipwalton.com/) in his [solved-by-flexbox project](https://github.com/philipwalton/solved-by-flexbox) lists 6 classic problems (as of this writing) and extensively discusses the previous limitations with css and the current solution flexbox provides.

I advice you go take a look. It's so good, I could have lifted the contents. However, in the practical section below, I'd explain some of the concepts he addresses as I walk you through building a practical layout with flexbox.

## Flexbugs and gotchas for non-compliant browsers
If you're the guy that writes css in their dreams and even if you're not, [you should watch this github repository](https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs). Some guys smarter than I am curate a list of flexbox bugs and their workarounds there. It's the first place I look when something isn't working as i expect.

I'll be working you through some prominent bugs in the practical section below too.
